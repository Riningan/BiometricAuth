# BiometricAuthDialog
Add Biometric Authentication Dialog to any Android app</br>

This library provides an easy way to implement fingerprint authentication without having to deal with all the boilerplate stuff going on inside.


USAGE
---

1. Include the library

```gradle
dependencies {
        implementation 'com.riningan.widget:biometricauthdialog:1.0'
}
```

2. Build dialog

```
new BiometricBuilder(MainActivity.this)
                        .setTitle("Add a title")
                        .setSubtitle("Add a subtitle")
                        .setDescription("Add a description")
                        .setNegativeButtonText("Add a cancel button")
                        .setHelpMessage("Add help message only for pre AndroidP")
                        .build()
                        .authenticate(biometricCallback);
```

3. Implement callback

The ```BiometricCallback``` class has the following callback methods:

```
new BiometricCallback() {
              @Override
              public void onSdkVersionNotSupported() {
                     /*  
                      *  Will be called if the device sdk version does not support Biometric authentication
                      */
               }

               @Override
               public void onBiometricAuthenticationNotSupported() {
                     /*  
                      *  Will be called if the device does not contain any fingerprint sensors 
                      */
               }

               @Override
               public void onBiometricAuthenticationNotAvailable() {
                    /*  
                     *  The device does not have any biometrics registered in the device.
                     */
               }

               @Override
               public void onBiometricAuthenticationPermissionNotGranted() {
                      /*  
                       *  android.permission.USE_BIOMETRIC permission is not granted to the app
                       */
               }

               @Override
               public void onAuthenticationFailed() {
                      /*  
                       * When the fingerprint doesnâ€™t match with any of the fingerprints registered on the device, 
                       * then this callback will be triggered.
                       */
               }

               @Override
               public void onAuthenticationCancelled() {
                       /*  
                        * The authentication is cancelled by the user. 
                        */
               }

               @Override
               public void onAuthenticationSuccessful() {
                        /*  
                         * When the fingerprint is has been successfully matched with one of the fingerprints   
                         * registered on the device, then this callback will be triggered. 
                         */
               }

               @Override
               public void onAuthenticationHelp(int helpCode, CharSequence helpString) {
                         /*  
                          * This method is called when a non-fatal error has occurred during the authentication 
                          * process. The callback will be provided with an help code to identify the cause of the 
                          * error, along with a help message.
                          */
                }

                @Override
                public void onAuthenticationError(int errorCode, CharSequence errString) {
                         /*  
                          * When an unrecoverable error has been encountered and the authentication process has 
                          * completed without success, then this callback will be triggered. The callback is provided 
                          * with an error code to identify the cause of the error, along with the error message. 
                          */
                 }
              });

```
